# HSF-styles

This repository is the template and starting point to create a HSF module as outlined [here](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/howto-new-module).

## Keep it in sync with the carpentry's version

This repository is based on [the carpentry's style](https://github.com/carpentries/styles) and should be kept in sync.
That means that you should pull from it on a regular basis:

```sh
git remote add carpentry https://github.com/carpentries/styles.git
git config --local remote.carpentry.tagOpt --no-tags
git pull carpentry gh-pages
```
